This is the Fred01 MyRobotLab program Scripts

This Raspberry Pi 3 (RPi3) has all the servo's
The Microphones and the speaker attached
The entire RPi3 is then controlled by the master 
controller Fred00 using the RemoteAdapter Service.

In the head of Fred InMoov you will find RPi3 with an 
Adafruit 16 channel Pulse Width Modlated (PWM) servo 
driver Hat. https://www.adafruit.com/product/2327 
in the back of Fred in an Adafuit 16 channel PWM driver
board. https://www.adafruit.com/product/815

Your will also find the 16 channel PWM boards in each
of Fred's Bicep's

So whats the difference between the board and the hat?
A Hat will plug onto a Raspberry Pi
A Shield will plug onto an Arduino
and a Board is stand alone.
